I use dark theme, and on the dark theme, the minimap is white and the text is white, so it is a bit hard to see what is going on. Also, after a while, it starts to slow down and freeze a bit. I really like this idea and, to be honest, for my jobe, I would add a minimap to browser, but it is probably too complicated and the browsers might not allow to do that.",
